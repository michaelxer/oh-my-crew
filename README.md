## What is this?

**Oh My Crew** is a fork of [oh-my-openagent](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent) (by [@code-yeongyu](https://github.com/code-yeongyu)), based on [oh-my-china](https://github.com/enowdev/oh-my-china) (by [@enowdev](https://github.com/enowdev)), with the following modifications:

1. **System prompts adjusted** to pass through AI proxy content filters
2. **All agents renamed** to clean, role-descriptive crew names -- no political, cultural, or mythological references

### Agent Roster

| Original | Crew Name | Role |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Sisyphus | **Captain** | Main orchestrator. Steers the ship. |
| Hephaestus | **Strategist** | Autonomous deep worker. Plans and executes. |
| Oracle | **Sage** | Read-only consultant. Wisdom without action. |
| Librarian | **Scribe** | External docs search. Finds written knowledge. |
| Explore | **Scout** | Codebase search. Reconnaissance specialist. |
| Atlas | **Foreman** | Todo orchestrator. Keeps work on track. |
| Prometheus | **Architect** | Strategic planner. Designs before building. |
| Metis | **Advisor** | Pre-planning consultant. Identifies risks. |
| Momus | **Auditor** | Plan reviewer/critic. The quality gate. |
| Sisyphus-Junior | **Cadet** | Task executor. Follows orders. |
| Multimodal Looker | **Lookout** | Vision/PDF analysis. Sharp-eyed observer. |

### Content Filter Fix

The phrase `"Powerful AI Agent"` combined with identity override directives triggers some AI proxy content filters. This fork replaces it with softer phrasing that passes through.

### Session Guardian (NEW)

Built-in skill that gives agents **autonomous session lifecycle management**:

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Git Checkpoints** | Auto-commits after each completed task. One commit per task, conventional commit messages. |
| **Context Monitoring** | Tracks context window usage via heuristics + system signals. Knows when to stop. |
| **Smart Handoff Timing** | Never interrupts mid-task. Finishes current work first, then creates handoff. |
| **Structured Handoff Docs** | Generates `HANDOFF_DOC/handoff-NNN.md` with full context for the next session. |
| **Chain Continuity** | Each handoff carries forward decisions and context from ALL previous sessions. |
| **Copy-Paste Resume** | Outputs a ready-to-paste prompt for starting the next session seamlessly. |
| **Credentials Protection** | Manages `.credentials/` folder for API keys, tokens, passwords. Auto-added to `.gitignore`. Agents never hardcode secrets in source code. |

**How it works:**

```text
Agent works -> completes task -> git commit -> checks context level
  |- Context OK -> picks up next task
  \- Context high (65%+) -> creates handoff -> provides resume prompt -> stops
```

The handoff files are saved to `HANDOFF_DOC/` in your project root (auto-added to `.gitignore`). Sensitive credentials go in `.credentials/` (also auto-gitignored). When starting a new session, paste the provided prompt and the agent picks up exactly where it left off.

Session Guardian is **auto-loaded** for Captain and Strategist -- no configuration needed.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/docs) installed
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (includes npm)

### Step 1: Add to plugin config

#### Agent-guided install

Paste this into your LLM agent session. The agent will ask the setup questions in chat, then run the installer with `--no-tui` so the terminal command itself does not open a menu:

```text
Install and configure oh-my-crew by following the instructions here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelxer/oh-my-crew/refs/heads/oh-my-crew/docs/guide/installation.md
```

This URL is instructions for the agent, not the installer itself. LLM agents should fetch/read the guide with `curl.exe` on Windows PowerShell or `curl` in POSIX shells:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelxer/oh-my-crew/refs/heads/oh-my-crew/docs/guide/installation.md
```

If you are installing directly as a human, skip the `curl` step and run the terminal wizard below.

If you paste the guide into OpenCode and the agent says the `opencode` command is missing, that usually only means the CLI is not on the agent shell's PATH. Since you are already inside OpenCode, the agent should continue the OMC setup and ask you to restart OpenCode after configuration.

#### Terminal wizard

If you are installing yourself, run this in a real terminal such as PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Terminal, iTerm, or your Linux shell. Do not run the interactive wizard inside an OpenCode agent/chat message, because agents usually cannot display terminal menus. The terminal wizard will ask the setup questions there:

```bash
npx oh-my-crew@latest install
```

or:

```bash
bunx oh-my-crew@latest install
```

If you want an OpenCode agent to install OMC for you, use the agent-guided prompt above instead. The agent will ask questions in chat and then run the non-interactive installer with your answers.

The npm package runs the JS installer directly, so normal `npx`/`bunx` installs do not require any separate Windows, Linux, or macOS binary package.

For scripted setup and full LLM-agent instructions, see [docs/guide/installation.md](docs/guide/installation.md). In this project, `--no-tui` means "no terminal menu"; it does not mean "no questions". The agent can still ask questions in chat and pass your answers as flags.

The installer supports Claude, OpenAI/ChatGPT, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode Zen, Z.ai, Kimi, OpenCode Go, Vercel AI Gateway, and custom OpenAI-compatible providers. It asks only the setup questions needed for the provider path you choose.

At the end, the installer writes the OpenCode plugin config, writes `oh-my-crew.json`, and shows the generated model assignments for the crew plus the verification commands. Agent-guided installs should also summarize each crew role and the main OMC features: `ultrawork`/`ulw`, Architect/Planner mode, background agents, Session Guardian handoffs, built-in MCPs, LSP/AST-Grep tools, and model fallbacks.

Manual config is also supported.

Edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (or `opencode.jsonc`) and add `"oh-my-crew"` to the plugin array:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["oh-my-crew"]
}
```

> **Recommended:** Use `"oh-my-crew"` only. It includes everything you need from OMO and avoids dropdown duplication plus sub-agent routing conflicts.
>
> **Important:** If you keep `"oh-my-openagent@latest"` alongside OMC, you may get duplicate dropdown entries and old OMO sub-agent prompts can still win at runtime. For the cleanest setup, remove OMO and run OMC independently.

### Step 2: Restart OpenCode

OpenCode will auto-install the plugin from npm on startup. If the crew agents don't appear, install manually:

```bash
cd ~/.config/opencode
npm install oh-my-crew --save
```

Then restart OpenCode again.

### Step 3: Verify

```bash
opencode
opencode agent list
# You should see Captain, Strategist, Foreman, Sage, etc. in the agent dropdown/list
# Type "ultrawork" to activate all agents
```

### Configure your proxy provider

```json
{
  "provider": {
    "your-proxy": {
      "type": "openai",
      "url": "http://your-proxy:port/v1",
      "key": "your-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

Anonymous telemetry is enabled by default to track active installations (DAU/WAU/MAU). A single event is sent at most once per UTC day per machine using a hashed installation identifier, never the raw hostname, and PostHog person profiles are not created. Disable with `npx oh-my-crew install --disable-telemetry`, `OMO_SEND_ANONYMOUS_TELEMETRY=0`, or `OMO_DISABLE_POSTHOG=1`. See [Privacy Policy](docs/legal/privacy-policy.md) and [Terms of Service](docs/legal/terms-of-service.md).

## Install from source (for developers)

Only needed if you want to modify the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelxer/oh-my-crew.git
cd oh-my-crew
bun install
bun run build
bun link
```

Then add `"oh-my-crew"` to your `opencode.json` plugin array.
